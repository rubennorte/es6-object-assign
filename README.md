# ES6 Object.assign()

ECMAScript 6 [Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) polyfill and ponyfill.

The main definition of this package has been copied from the polyfill defined in the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign).

## Installation

### Node 

```bash
npm install es6-object-assign
```

### Browser

The package is also available as a UMD module (compatible with AMD, CommonJS and exposing a global variable `ObjectAssign`) in `dist/object-assign.js` and `dist/object-assign.min.js` (833 bytes minified and gzipped).

It can be installed with npm or downloading the release from GitHub:

```bash
npm install es6-object-assign
```

## Usage

As a polyfill, defining Object.assign() if it is not already defined:

```javascript
require('es6-object-assign').polyfill();
// or
window.ObjectAssign.polyfill();
```

As a polyfill, loading the assign function to a variable:

```javascript
var assign = require('es6-object-assign').assign;
// or
var assign = window.ObjectAssign.assign;
```
